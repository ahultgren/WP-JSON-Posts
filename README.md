#WP JSON Posts#

Echoes posts as JSON instead of using the template. Works for the front page, static pages, single posts, custom post types, archives etc.

_Note: Currently this plugin does not support custom queries that might be added in the tempalate. Only built in url's and their original results may be fetched._

##Basic usage##

* Download WP JSON Posts
* Upload the plugin to your Wordpress installation
* Install WP JSON Posts
* Visit any page or post
* Add `?jsonposts=1` (or `&jsonposts=1`, if there's already a question mark in the URL)
* Voila, you got JSON!
