##Parameters

All paramters are sent as a query string in the URL.

###Exclude

Most of the time you don't want all post data but only parts of it.
To save banwitdh you can customize what data to return. This is done using the parameter `&exclude`.
What to exclude is specified using the same name as wordpress uses for it's functions and are also
those found in the returned data. Multiple values are dash-separated (-). 
Thus if you see that you don't need `the_post_thumbnail` or `custom_fields` you simply send 
`&exclude=the_post_thumbnail-custom_fields`.

###Number of posts

If you want a different number of posts returned than what the default wp_query would give you,
simply append `&number_of_posts=2` to the URL. Of course this will not work for a single post or page.

###Offset

If you wanna get for example just a few posts at the time from the front page, you have to change the
starting post each time. This is done by adding `&offset=5' to the URL. Default is 0.

###Post thumbnail size

If you want the image thumbnail you might have to specify what size you want the featured image to be. 
`&imgsize=case` would return the image size named "case". Default is "small".

###Terms and categories

Since version 1.0.2 the_category have been replaced with the_terms['category'] and will be removed shortly.
Thus if you want the categories of the posts you need to append `&the_terms=category` to the URL.
As whith the exlude parameter, multiple values are dash-separated (-).
